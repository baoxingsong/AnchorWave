## My machine with built-in gcc <6. Even if I set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH to use new gcc, the source code still tried to use old gcc in /usr/bin and failed compilation.
The key is setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH before typing `cmake ./`. The easiest way maybe:
1) Delete the current source code using commands `rm -rf anchorwave`.
2) Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PATH`, `CC`, and `GCC` to the new gcc.
3) Re-clone the AnchorWave repository and compile it.
## Should I perform genome repeat masking before feed into AnchorWave
Genome masking is not expected to improve the performance of AnchorWave.  
AnchorWave do not utilize any soft masking information. Hard masking would increase the
computational cost of AnchorWave.
## End with error message "TransferGffWithNucmerResult.cpp:203"
`anchorwave: /net/eichler/vol26/projects/primate_sv/nobackups/Tools/anchorwave/src/service/TransferGffWithNucmerResult.cpp:203: void readSam(std::vector<AlignmentMatch>&, std::ifstream&, std::map<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char>, Transcript>&, int&, const double&, double&, std::set<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char> >&, const string&, int32_t&, int32_t&, int32_t&, int32_t&, int&, bool&, int&, std::map<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char>, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char> >&): Assertion 'databaseStart < databaseEnd' failed.`
`Aborted (core dumped)`
We observed three possibilities that cause this problem:
1. AnchorWave may check the open reading frame of the input GFF file and genome sequence. If there are many transcript annotations that do not start with a start codon, do not end with a stop codon, have premature stop codon or non-standard splice sites, AnchorWave maybe fail.
2. If inputting the CDS fasta file is generated by other applications, AnchorWave could fail. The `anchorwave gff2seq` command filter some short CDS records from the GFF file, to reduce problem that minimap2 could not deal with short CDS very well. Please use the fasta file generated by `anchorwave gff2seq` command as input for minimap2 and `anchorwave proali` or `anchorwave genoAli`.
3. If you set parameters `-x` or `-m` for `anchorwave gff2seq`, please set the identical parameter for `anchorwave proali` or `anchorwave genoAli`.
